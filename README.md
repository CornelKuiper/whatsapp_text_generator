# whatsapp text generator
Just send a backup of your whatsapp messages to your email and use this txt file as input.<br/>
The code whapp.py needs 4 arguments<br/>
Argument 1: the filename (and the path if necessary) (so whatsapp_messages.txt)<br/>
Argument 2: the length of the generated sentences<br/>
Argument 3: the amount of generated sentences<br/>
Argument 4: the minimum length of messages that are used for the chains (so if 5, messages with 5 words will not be used)<br/>
